## Overview

### The challenge

- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

**1. The `name` attribute for `<input>`**

Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted. If omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

```html
<input type="text" id="first-name" name="first-name" />
```

**2. `<input type="checkbox">` vs. `<input type="radio">`**

Where multiple same-named controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of them all, whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

```html
<input type="radio" id="general-enquiry" name="query-type" required />
...
<input type="radio" id="support-request" name="query-type" required />
```
